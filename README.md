## üí° Project Overview & Motivation

The **Smart Shopping Assistant** is an intuitive desktop application designed to empower your purchasing decisions for home appliances, specifically Air Conditioners and Smart TVs.

**The core purpose of building this application is to address a common frustration in online and traditional shopping: the lack of truly personalized and intelligent product recommendations.**

Currently, most online shopping platforms offer generic filters (e.g., filter by brand, price range). While useful if you already know *exactly* what you want, they fall short when a customer is unsure or wants a product tailored to specific, nuanced needs. Imagine you need an AC that's low on power consumption but you're indifferent to its noise level, or a TV with specific smart features but aren't tied to a particular brand. Standard filters can't grasp these preferences.

This is where the Smart Shopping Assistant comes in. Think of it as an **AI-powered salesperson, but without the pressure of a sale.** It's built to:

1.  **Understand Your Needs:** Through carefully designed questions and filters, the application gathers information about your priorities and preferences for a product's features.
2.  **Predict Price Range:** Leveraging advanced machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost in an Ensemble Voting Regressor), the assistant provides accurate price predictions based on your tailored desires.
3.  **Offer Tailored Recommendations:** Integrated with the cutting-edge Google Generative AI (Gemini) API, the application goes a step further. Instead of just showing products, it processes your unique requirements and provides a concise, intelligent recommendation that caters to your specific wants. For example, if low power consumption is paramount for your AC, the AI will suggest a model that prioritizes this, even if noise level isn't a concern.

While the current version utilizes the Gemini API for recommendations, the main idea is that in a real-world scenario, this AI prompt would interface with a comprehensive product database via an SQL query in the backend. This would allow the system to suggest actual products from specific companies that perfectly match the user's filtered and AI-interpreted needs.

Say goodbye to endless Browse and generic filters, and hello to smart, confident buying with truly personalized assistance!

## üöÄ How It Works

1.  **User Input:** You select desired features for either an Air Conditioner or a Smart TV through the interactive GUI.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Your selections, along with historical data, are meticulously cleaned and transformed (One-Hot Encoding for categorical data, Standardization for numerical data) to prepare them for the models.
3.  **Price Prediction:** The trained ensemble machine learning model takes your processed input and predicts an estimated market price for the product.
4.  **AI Recommendation:** Your chosen features are sent to the Google Gemini API, which processes the request and generates a tailored product recommendation, suggesting the most suitable brand/model based on the specified criteria.
5.  **Results Display:** Both the predicted price and the AI-generated recommendation are displayed clearly in the application, helping you make an informed decision.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

To get the Smart Shopping Assistant up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local system using Git:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Aaiz-Am17/Smart-Shopping-Assistant.git](https://github.com/Aaiz-Am17/Smart-Shopping-Assistant.git)
cd Smart-Shopping-Assistant
````

### 2\. Place Dataset Files

**Create a `data` folder** inside the `Smart-Shopping-Assistant` directory, and **place your `Air_condition_dataset.csv` and `TELEVISION.csv` files inside it.**

The final structure should look like this:

```
Smart-Shopping-Assistant/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Air_condition_dataset.csv
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TELEVISION.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ac_model.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Next, **update the file paths in `main.py`** to reflect this new structure. They should now be relative to the `main.py` file:

```python
# In main.py
import os

# Get the directory of the current script (main.py)
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Construct paths relative to the script's directory
AC_FILE_PATH = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "data", "Air_condition_dataset.csv")
TV_FILE_PATH = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "data", "TELEVISION.csv")
```

Using `os.path.join` and `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` makes your paths **operating system independent** and ensures they work whether your project is cloned or moved around\!

### 3\. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**Activate the virtual environment:**

  * **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  * **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 4\. Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install all required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5\. Get a Google Generative AI API Key

To enable the AI recommendation feature, you'll need an API key from Google AI Studio.

1.  Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

2.  Follow the instructions to create a new API key.

3.  **Update the `API_KEY` variable in `main.py`** with your generated key:

    ```python
    # In main.py
    API_KEY = "YOUR_GENERATED_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

    ***Note:*** *Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly in your code or commits. For production applications, it's recommended to use environment variables.*

### 6\. Run the Application

Once all the above steps are complete, you can run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the CustomTkinter GUI for the Smart Shopping Assistant.
